Task 1: Calculator
The calculator task involves creating a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations. The user is prompted to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The program then performs the selected operation on the given numbers and displays the result.

Task 2: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game task is about creating a Python program that allows the user to play against the computer. The user is prompted to choose either rock, paper, or scissors. The computer generates its choice randomly. The program determines the winner based on the choices made by the user and the computer, following the rule that rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The result of the game (win, lose, or tie) is displayed to the user.

Task 3: Password Generator
The password generator task focuses on creating a Python program that generates strong and random passwords. The user is prompted to specify the desired length of the password. The program then uses a combination of random characters (letters, digits, and punctuation) to generate a password of the specified length. The generated password is then displayed on the screen.

These tasks cover a range of programming concepts such as user input, random number generation, conditional statements, functions, and user interfaces.
